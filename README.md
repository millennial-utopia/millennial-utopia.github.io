# millennial-utopia.github.io

This is the website containing all of the collected writing on the Millennial Utopian idea and its fictional model, Lemontopia.

`./site` is where GitHub hosts the site from; it has all the compiled HTML/CSS/JS, and is only intended to be human-readable via a browser.

## Credits

A huge amount of layout, stylistic choices, and other widgets and bits are borrowed from people who are much better at frontend design than I am. I credit all of these folks in code comments wherever relevant, but I will also try to collect those sources here so that no one has to go digging around for them.

The site itself is generated by [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll), which is a static site generator written in Haskell by Jasper Van der Jeugt. Hakyll is under a [BSD license](https://github.com/jaspervdj/hakyll/blob/master/LICENSE), except for the parts that use Pandoc, which are under a matching GPL license.

Page content is compiled to HTML by John MacFarlane's [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), under a [GPL license](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/blob/master/COPYRIGHT).

The color scheme is [Atelier Savanna](https://github.com/atelierbram/base16-atelier-schemes), by Bram de Haan. Which colors go where is guided by Chris Kempson's [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) theme architecture. Both are under an [MIT license](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

The CSS shadows under "cards" (and, really, the card concept itself) were adapted from Google's [Material Design spec](https://material.io/components/cards), also under [MIT license](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/blob/master/LICENSE).

The visual design for the tabs was adapted from [this CodePen demo](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/GRMbzBR) by [https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo](`@alvarotrigo`).
