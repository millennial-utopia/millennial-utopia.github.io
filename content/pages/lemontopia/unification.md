## Setting: Betaria, Year 0 (the eve of unification).

Citara is a crumbling theocracy. Public confidence is waning, food is scarcer, and even the sacred lemon grove has suffered from blight. Redvale, by contrast, has become a thriving, egalitarian town of free citizens and cooperative institutions. The conflict is no longer between equals—it’s a managed unraveling.

## Main Characters
1. Alin Karro – The Scout Turned Courier
    * Originally dispatched by Citara five years earlier to locate and assess the renegade settlement.
    * Alin defected after living briefly among the Redvalers and now lives a double life: running a quiet spy network inside Citara and guiding defectors through the hidden trails along the Rhizel’s tributaries.
    * Torn between guilt at betraying his homeland and hope for something better.

2. Priest-General Marthen
    * The last remaining high official with real control in Citara.
    * Ruthlessly intelligent but visibly aging under the pressure of holding a dying system together.
    * Implements reforms in a last-ditch effort: elevating commoners to priesthood, promising land titles, introducing new ceremonies to restore faith—but it only accelerates collapse.

3. Daya Vesh – Redvaler Diplomat and Spy Handler
    * Grew up in Redvale. Sharp, strategic, and deeply empathetic.
    * Manages intelligence from inside Citara, trains exiles, and recruits idealists within the Citaran ranks to act as seeds for change.
    * Believes unification must come not through conquest, but through conversion.

## Plot Outline

### Act I – Echoes in the Grove
* Redvale has intercepted news of another planned raid.
* Alin meets secretly with Daya in a citrus orchard outside Citara under the pretense of delivering farming supplies.
* The raid is canceled—not by confrontation, but because half the raiding party defects in advance, tipped off and offered safe passage.

### Act II – A Desperate Pivot
* Marthen realizes that Redvale isn’t just surviving—it’s pulling people in by choice.
* In a bold move, he starts elevating citizens to mid-level priesthoods, hoping that power and status will keep them loyal.
* But Daya has already seeded these candidates with ideas and quiet alliances: they accept the robes, but shift the rhetoric subtly—talking more of fairness than of divine order.

### Act III – Infiltration and Substitution
* The spy network inside Citara becomes self-sustaining. A young priest openly quotes Redvaler thinkers during a public ceremony, drawing cheers from the crowd.
* Citaran citizens begin referring to the Redvalers as “our cousins,” no longer rebels.
* Factions form within Citara’s ruling class, and some temple guards simply stop reporting for duty.

### Act IV – The Silent End
* Marthen makes one final speech to a half-empty hall. In it, he doesn’t call for violence but laments the loss of “truth.” He knows he’s lost but bows out with dignity.
* A joint delegation from Redvale arrives—unarmed—to begin the formal process of merging councils, issuing amnesty, and redistributing remaining resources.

### Coda – The First Vote
* A week later, a public vote is held in Citara on the adoption of the Millennial Social Code.
* Alin watches from a rooftop, lemon blossoms drifting in the breeze.
* The motion passes by overwhelming majority.
