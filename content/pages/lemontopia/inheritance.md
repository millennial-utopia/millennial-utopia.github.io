A renowned toolmaker passes away, leaving behind a workshop and an enormous stockpile of agricultural tools. Their estranged children argue bitterly over who should inherit, but another member of the community proposes a common stewardship approach—converting the workshop into a public fabrication lab.

This introduces the concept of voluntary collectivization: rather than everything being immediately communal, some citizens may choose to donate their property for broader benefit. It sparks a cultural movement known as the Second Harvest, focused on gifting and mutual legacy.
