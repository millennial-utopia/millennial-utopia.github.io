title: Lemontopia Overview & Timeline

On the island of Betaria lives a modest agrarian society. They rely on a single miraculous crop: a nutritionally complete variety of the humble sugar beet that fulfills all of their basic needs. Of the three hundred or so Betarians, a few dozen farm beets along the Rhizel River, whose annual floods replenish the soil and keep the entire population fed.

The island also hosts a grove of lemon trees, around which the civic center and main village of Citara grew. Lemons are deeply important to Betarian life: once a symbol of wealth and exclusivity in [The Bad Times][], they have since made the [transition into currency][The Lemon Blight], flowing outward as wages and inward as payment for goods and services---echoing the seasonal inundation that sustains them all.

The society of the Betarians---_Lemontopia_, as it's sometimes called by crass outsiders---is of course far simpler than the high-tech civilizations of Earth, with their intricate supply chains and vast infrastructure. Yet it offers a model for how a society that produces more than it needs might function without requiring everyone to work, and how such a world might rise from the barren soil of deep inequality.
