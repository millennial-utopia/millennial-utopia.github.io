As the post-unification economy stabilizes, a growing number of Betarians find themselves without necessary labor assignments. While some pursue music, art, and games, a vocal minority begins to argue that everyone should contribute something tangibleâ€”suggesting rotational field work or mandatory civic service.

The council holds a series of open forums, where people make their case for self-directed purpose versus imposed contribution. In the end, the Betarians vote to affirm voluntary contribution, but the discussion prompts the creation of a Public Works Registry to support and amplify self-initiated projects of cultural value.
