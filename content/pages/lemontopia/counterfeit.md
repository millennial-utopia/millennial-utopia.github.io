Betaria’s peaceful rhythm is disrupted when irregularities are discovered in the flow of Lems—specifically, a small batch of suspicious coins circulating in Citara’s western quarter. While no one is directly harmed by the counterfeit currency, the issue threatens to undermine the fragile trust that sustains Betaria’s post-physical money economy.

The Council appoints an investigator, Sela of Redvale, to quietly trace the source without causing alarm. As Sela delves deeper, she uncovers not a malicious plot, but the desperate actions of a young artisan who saw the system’s goodwill as an opportunity rather than a responsibility.

The case prompts a broader public discussion about the boundaries of trust, the importance of transparency in systems of exchange, and the careful balance between leniency and security. Ultimately, the artisan is given community service rather than punishment—teaching forgery detection and minting techniques in Citara’s education hall. The affair becomes a case study in proportionate justice and maintaining social cohesion without resorting to fear or punitive force.
