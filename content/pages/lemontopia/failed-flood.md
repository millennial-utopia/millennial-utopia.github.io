After the Rhizel failed to flood for the first time in living memory, panic struck. With only the prior year’s modest reserves to fall back on, rationing was harsh---and barely enough to preserve planting stock. But out of the crisis emerged a shift in thinking: reliance on the natural cycle alone was too fragile for a growing population.

In response, a coalition of beet farmers, early engineers, and record-keepers formed what became the Council of Sustenance, tasked with:

- Building floodplain cisterns to store excess water from prior years
- Developing irrigation canals and gates to control and distribute water more precisely
- Constructing sealed grain vaults for long-term beet storage, including trials with drying, pickling, and fermenting
- Launching the Resilience Program: a public works project dedicated to innovation, even in times of plenty

This becomes the first major institutional investment in high-risk, low-immediate-reward research, viewed skeptically by some as wasteful but later credited with ensuring the island’s long-term survival.
