A mysterious blight decimates the lemon harvest---and with it, the economy. With no lemons to distribute, trade halts, and status collapses into confusion.

A group of bureaucrats proposes replacing lemons with representative chits, and later, pure fiat paper Lems. The transition is contentious: some hoard the remaining lemons, and riots break out in Citara.

Eventually, with careful oversight, the system stabilizes. Lemons remain a cultural icon, but money is no longer tied to the grove.
