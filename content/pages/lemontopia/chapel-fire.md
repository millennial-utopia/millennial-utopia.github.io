In the early days after unification, tensions simmer between the largely secular Redvale and a small group in Citara who quietly maintain an old religious tradition from the Bad Times. Many Redvalers associate the faith with the former elite, who used religious authority to justify inequality and suppress dissent.

After a scuffle outside a modest chapel turns violent---leaving a young priest wounded---debate rages across the island. Is religion a private matter or a public threat?

The Council, led by formerly anti-religious Redvalers, delivers a measured response:

- The attack is denounced unequivocally.
- Freedom of conscience is enshrined as a civic right.
- At the same time, attempts to separate believers into closed enclaves or demand curriculum exemptions from public education are rejected.

In the words of Councilor Maev:

> Belief is your right. But truth belongs to all of us. You may believe differently, but not live apart---not when we’ve come so far to live together.

The event leads to the formal adoption of the Citara Accords, a short document affirming pluralism while setting boundaries to ensure shared public life isn’t eroded by ideological separatism.
