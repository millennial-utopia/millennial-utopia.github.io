## Premise
The Council continues shaping the foundational systems of unified Betaria. One major focus is education: a universal, secular curriculum designed to promote critical thinking, scientific literacy, and shared civic values. While most citizens support this direction, a small but vocal religious minority begins to fear marginalization—especially those who practiced faith openly under the old Citaran regime.

## Main Plot
As tensions rise, a small chapel on the outskirts of Redvale—one of the few religious sites still in regular use—is set ablaze in the middle of the night. The fire guts the structure. No one is harmed, but the symbolism is explosive.

Among the chapel’s small congregation is Marthen, the former Priest-General, who since unification has renounced political leadership and lives quietly as a community priest. Though controversial, he is respected by many for stepping down peacefully and choosing humility over rebellion.

The community is rattled. Accusations fly. Some demand a clampdown on anti-religious speech; others fear an opportunistic grab for special status by the religious minority. A Redvale councilor speaks out forcefully: the arson is condemned without reservation—but the right to private and public faith must be preserved without granting it special authority.

## Themes and Tensions
The Council debates whether the rebuilding of the chapel should be publicly funded.

Marthen quietly proposes a compromise: rather than full state funding, the chapel applies for a Cultural Project Grant, a new initiative that allows for limited, transparently administered public support for non-essential—but culturally significant—projects.

A broader discussion unfolds about how to define "cultural value" in a pluralistic society.

The culprit, when found, turns out to be a disillusioned young revolutionary who feared a return to theocracy. The case becomes a public opportunity to reinforce norms of peaceful dissent and the importance of distinguishing personal trauma from policy.

## Aftermath
The rebuilt chapel is smaller but lovingly restored with volunteer help and modest public funds. The Cultural Project Grant system gains broader visibility, and the Council formalizes the right to practice faith, provided it remains separate from state power and education.
Marthen, once again, recedes quietly into the background—but his example helps defuse a moment that could have reignited old wars.
