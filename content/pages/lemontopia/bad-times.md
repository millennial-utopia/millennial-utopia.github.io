Long ago, in the Bad Times, the fertile floodplains and the sacred lemon grove were monopolized by a ruling class in Citara, who distributed resources based on lineage and loyalty. Most lived in hunger and squalor, punished for the circumstances of their birth or perceived disobedience.

A small group of dissenters fled and began cultivating beets on marginal land, distributing them equitably among themselves. This would eventually grow to become the rival village of Redvale.
