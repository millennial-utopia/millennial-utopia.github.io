## Setting: Citara, Year -9 (nine years before unification).

A deeply stratified society, where access to fertile land, education, and religious rites is tightly controlled by a priestly caste. The lemon grove is considered sacred and symbolic of divine authority. Theocratic rule mixes spiritual dogma with practical power—land ownership is hereditary, justified by ritual. Farming is done by bonded laborers who receive rations but little else.

## Characters / Families
1. The Salma Family – Former Landholders in Decline
  * Conflict: Once minor nobility, the Salmas fell out of favor after supporting a failed reformist priest. They live under house arrest and are forbidden from owning land. Their son, Tarin, is bitter but idealistic.
  * Viewpoint: They expose how dissent is suppressed and how loyalty to values over authority can result in quiet exile, not execution—but only just.
  * Contribution: Tarin has formal education in agronomy and water management; he carries valuable skills and maps from his family's old estate.

2. The Dareth Family – Bonded Laborers
  * Conflict: Multi-generational beet farmers near the river, the Dareths are bound to work the land for a landholding family in exchange for food and shelter. Iris Dareth, a sharp-minded mother of three, is furious that her teenage daughter is being pressured to “enter service” at the temple—a euphemism for servitude cloaked in ritual.
  * Viewpoint: Shows the economic and bodily exploitation under theocratic control. Religion is used to sanctify labor extraction and keep the poor in place.
  * Contribution: Iris knows how to actually grow beets and organize labor. She has community ties with other bonded workers and an instinct for logistics.

3. The Inakos – Refugee Artisans
  * Conflict: Originally from a village destroyed in a river shift and denied relocation rights, the Inakos family squats in the outskirts of Citara. Niko Inako forges tools in a hidden kiln and Vela, his partner, is a midwife turned underground teacher.
  * Viewpoint: Illustrates how climate events exacerbate inequality and how some displaced people become invisible. Also, how tradition limits knowledge-sharing—only sanctioned priests are supposed to teach.
  * Contribution: Niko and Vela bring technical know-how, a stash of hidden tools, and the moral authority of community caretakers. Vela dreams of a free school where all children learn.

## Plot Outline

### Act I – Quiet Desperation
* A minor flood damages Citara’s southern quarter, causing unrest and resource strain.
* Tarin, under surveillance, contacts Iris covertly while working on a flood-mitigation team; he admires her fire.
* Iris saves Niko’s child during a crisis and learns of their hidden smithy.
* The three families realize they share a vision of a better life, but escaping is dangerous—routes out of the fertile lowlands are watched, and religious exile is forbidden.

### Act II – The Pact
* After a tragic incident (perhaps Iris’s daughter is publicly shamed or assaulted by temple officials), the families convene in secret.
* Tarin shares knowledge of an abandoned terraced slope upstream with old irrigation channels and softer soil—survivable, if hard.
* They agree: they will gather trusted allies and flee under the guise of a sanctioned pilgrimage.
* Each family risks everything—burning old bridges, stealing or destroying documents, bribing low-ranking guards, and quietly packing tools and seed stock.

### Act III – The Crossing
* The journey upriver is tense. At one point they’re nearly caught by patrols, and must make a dangerous night crossing through the Rhizel’s marsh.
* Vela delivers a child mid-journey; the group delays a day, at great risk, to let them recover—cementing their bond and emphasizing their values.
* They arrive at a valley ringed by hills and shaded by red-leaved trees: they name it Redvale.
* They plant their first beets together, building simple shelters and setting up a shared council.

### Coda – First Sprout
The story ends with the first shoots breaking soil, and a quiet vow that no child of Redvale will ever go hungry or be owned.
