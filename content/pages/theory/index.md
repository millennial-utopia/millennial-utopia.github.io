title: A Millennial Utopia
------------------------

### Core Principles

The MU's philosophy begins with the [Millennial Social Code][msc], a declaration of rights that we believe should belong equally to every person. We believe that in any sufficiently advanced, high-tech society, it’s not only possible but realistic to guarantee those rights for everyone.

[A Millennial Utopia][] imagines what such a society might look like if it already existed on Earth today. Actually building one---without violence or coercion---will take time. [Transitioning From Capitalism][transition] outlines a peaceful, long-term path toward that future.

### Is it possible?

We think so. But we’re working on gathering [solid data][Proving MU Viability] before declaring it proven.

Our central claim is this: in a high-tech society, there's enough industry and automation that not everyone needs to work in order to keep everyone housed, fed, healthy, and---just as importantly---free to live without fear of losing those essentials. You can read more about how we plan to validate this claim in [Proving MU Viability][].

Outside of those essential services---which any government committed to the Millennial Social Code must guarantee---everything else (science, ice cream parlors, art exhibits, roller coasters…) can still flourish through an open market. But that system doesn't need to rely on the traditional capitalist system of investment bankers and shareholder dividends---a system that has enabled centuries of exploitation, corruption, and abuse. It continues to do so today. For a deeper look at those harms---and how a Millennial Utopia might avoid them---see [Equitable Management and Distribution of Shared Resources][].
