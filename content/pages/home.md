This site hosts a collection of writing and data about a hypothetical social, economic, and political system collectively referred to as the _Millennial Utopia_. The name reflects the belief that this system could be achievable in human society with the tools available to us since the early third millennium.

The site is divided into two main sections:

## Theory

[Foundations][msc] and proposals for the [structure][constitution] of the MU, including a [discussion of its basic principles][A Millennial Utopia] and a [roadmap for real-world implementation][transition].

A full listing of all of the theory pages currently written can be found [here](/theory/).

## Lemontopia

Stories about fictional micro-society that explores MU concepts in action, set on a small island with a particular fondness for a certain citrus fruit.

More details about the Lemontopians and a timeline can be found [here](/lemontopia/).
