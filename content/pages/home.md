The world we inherited from the last millennium is broken. But we already have the tools to build something better.

_Millennial Utopia_ is a project exploring how we might construct a more just, sustainable, and livable society using technologies and knowledge already at our disposal.

The site is divided into two main sections:

## [Theory](/theory/)

[Foundations][msc] and proposals for the [structure][constitution] of the MU, including a [discussion of its basic principles][A Millennial Utopia] and a [roadmap for real-world implementation][transition].

## [Lemontopia](/lemontopia/)

A collection of short stories about a fictional agrarian micro-society with a curious fondness for a certain citrus fruit. These stories trace [the evolution][Lemontopia Timeline] of this society from its [theocratic roots][The Bad Times] to the [centennial][The Lemonade Centennial] of its unification under a post-scarcity system inspired by the Millennial Utopian model. Along the way, the stories explore how this society was able to meet a variety of [social][The Growing Question], [political][The Redvale Affair], and [economic][The Failed Flood] challenges with limited resources.
