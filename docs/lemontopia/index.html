    <p>On the island of Betaria lives a modest agrarian society. They rely on a single miraculous crop: a nutritionally complete variety of the humble sugar beet that fulfills all of their basic needs. Of the three hundred or so Betarians, a few dozen farm beets along the Rhizel River, whose annual floods replenish the soil and keep the entire population fed.</p>
<p>The island also hosts a grove of lemon trees, around which the civic center and main village of Citara grew. Lemons are deeply important to Betarian life: once a symbol of wealth and exclusivity in <a href="../lemontopia/bad-times.html">The Bad Times</a>, they have since made the <a href="../lemontopia/lemon-blight.html">transition into currency</a>, flowing outward as wages and inward as payment for goods and services—echoing the seasonal inundation that sustains them all.</p>
<p>The society of the Betarians—<em>Lemontopia</em>, as it’s sometimes called by crass outsiders—is of course far simpler than the high-tech civilizations of Earth, with their intricate supply chains and vast infrastructure. Yet it offers a model for how a society that produces more than it needs might function without requiring everyone to work, and how such a world might rise from the barren soil of deep inequality.</p>

      <div class="timeline-blurb">Before unification, Citara's ruling elite controlled the lemon grove and the fertile banks of the Rhizel, hoarding resources and leaving many to struggle with hunger and poverty. A few defiant families fled to the wilderness to build something fairer.</div>

      <div class="timeline-blurb">The beet-farming outpost of Redvale grows into a thriving rival to Citara, offering food and dignity to all. As more citizens defect, the old elite collapse, and the first post-unification harvest marks Year 0 of a new calendar.</div>

      <h4 class="timeline-title"><a href="./redvale-affair.html">The Redvale Affair</a></h4>
      <div class="timeline-blurb">An assassination attempt on the new president shakes the young government. Though the perpetrator is captured, the deaths of guards and bystanders ignite a furious public debate over whether the death penalty has any place in Betaria.</div>

      <div class="timeline-year">5</div>
      <h4 class="timeline-title"><a href="./idle-hands.html">The Idle Hands Debate</a></h4>
      <div class="timeline-blurb">As automation and efficiency reduce the need for labor, Betaria faces a new question: what role should work play in a society where everyone's basic needs are met? Public forums explore how to value caretaking, art, research, and play.</div>
    </div><div class="timeline-card">
      <div class="timeline-year">10</div>
      <h4 class="timeline-title"><a href="./failed-flood.html">The Failed Flood</a></h4>
      <div class="timeline-blurb">A rare dry season breaks the annual rhythm of the Rhizel, endangering the next harvest. Rationing is introduced, and the crisis catalyzes the development of irrigation systems and surplus management strategies.</div>
    </div><div class="timeline-card">
      <div class="timeline-year">23</div>
      <h4 class="timeline-title"><a href="./inheritance.html">The Inheritance Dispute</a></h4>
      <div class="timeline-blurb">When a master toolmaker dies, their vast collection of hand-crafted implements becomes the subject of bitter contention among estranged heirs. A neighbor suggests a novel solution: turning the workshop into a shared public resource. The community’s embrace of this idea marks the beginning of the Second Harvest, a cultural movement celebrating voluntary gifting and mutual legacy.</div>

      <h4 class="timeline-title"><a href="./counterfeit.html">The Counterfeit Case</a></h4>

      <h4 class="timeline-title"><a href="./growing.html">The Growing Question</a></h4>

      <h4 class="timeline-title"><a href="./lemonade.html">The Lemonade Centennial</a></h4>
