    <p>Tarin Salma stood in the muddy street, looking downriver toward where the Rhizel overflowed its levees, depositing silt and filth among the tenements near the southern wall of Citara. This year’s flood wasn’t even particulary severe, he knew. But the temple’s remaining hydrologists were too busy beautifying the priests’ manors upstream, near the Grove, and they hardly ever came to this part of the city anyway. When the stench finally began to drift into the Temple Quarter, however, some priestly functionary had remembered that the disgraced Salma clan had a son with the proper training. And so here he was: escorted by a temple proctor, wearing novice greys despite having earned his journeyman’s robe before his family’s fall from grace.</p>
<p>Even before they set out, Tarin knew what he would find: the riverbed here hadn’t been properly dredged in at least two years. The Guild didn’t even bother to send the maintenance teams any more, but the Chief Hydrologist still signed off on the reports each month, and everyone just went on with their busy schedule of feasts and elaborate rituals. Tarin had seen all of it during his time in the Guild, and he’d known it was only a matter of time before something like this happened. Still, he welcomed the opportunity to leave his house—even under the watchful eye of a temple proctor.</p>
<p>He heard the man squelch up behind him and caught the sharp citrine scent of his expensively laundered uniform.</p>
<p>“Well?” the proctor asked peremptorily.</p>
<p>“It is possible that the embankment has shifted,” Tarin lied smoothly. “I’ll need to take measurements. I’ll also require a slate for calculations, and access to the Guild’s plans for this section of the river.”</p>
<p>The proctor snorted derisively. “All the guilds are closed for the Chief Arborer’s daughter’s birthday celebration. I should be there too. You can take it up with them tomorrow. This place reeks of outlander shit.”</p>
<p>Tarin gazed at the man coolly, considering the sort of person that the priesthood selected as proctors—and exactly whose sewage was washing downstream to pool at their feet. “There will still be guards at the Guild. Take me there and have them watch over me while I gather my supplies. Then you can go pay your respects to the Chief Arborer’s daughter. It’ll reflect well on you if I can get the river flowing properly again.”</p>
<p>The proctor pretended to think it over, then finally shrugged and began clumping back up the East Bank Road toward the Guilds Quarter. Tarin took a moment to glance around at the “outlanders” pulling their belongings from flooded shacks. Most had likely been born right here, or else were refugees from villages no more than a few hundred yards outside Citara’s walls—left homeless when the river shifted and swallowed their homes. <em>Outlander</em> was just an epithet the upstream elite used for anyone they considered unworthy of living in the City of the Grove. An absurdity, on an island so small that the farthest “outside” one could get was a day’s walk away.</p>
<p>As he started after the proctor, Tarin caught the eye of a woman standing a few paces off, her hands resting on the shoulders of a young girl who was clearly her daughter. Both watching him—not unfriendly, but intently, as though they saw something in him that marked him out from the other drab figures on the street. He smiled faintly and raised a hand to wave, but the proctor made an impatient sound and Tarin quickened his pace, pushing the pair from his mind. Soon his thoughts turned to the Guild archives. With only an indifferent guard to watch over him, he might be able to access far more than the standard maintenance records.</p>
<p>Tarin intended to make the most out of today’s excursion.</p>

<p>A deeply stratified society, where access to fertile land, education, and religious rites is tightly controlled by a priestly caste. The lemon grove is considered sacred and symbolic of divine authority. Theocratic rule mixes spiritual dogma with practical power—land ownership is hereditary, justified by ritual. Farming is done by bonded laborers who receive rations but little else.</p>
<h2 id="characters-families">Characters / Families<a href="#characters-families" class="material-symbols-outlined anchor" title="Characters / Families">anchor</a></h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Salma Family – Former Landholders in Decline</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Conflict: Once minor nobility, the Salmas fell out of favor after supporting a failed reformist priest. They live under house arrest and are forbidden from owning land. Their son, Tarin, is bitter but idealistic.</li>
<li>Viewpoint: They expose how dissent is suppressed and how loyalty to values over authority can result in quiet exile, not execution—but only just.</li>
<li>Contribution: Tarin has formal education in agronomy and water management; he carries valuable skills and maps from his family’s old estate.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Dareth Family – Bonded Laborers</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Conflict: Multi-generational beet farmers near the river, the Dareths are bound to work the land for a landholding family in exchange for food and shelter. Iris Dareth, a sharp-minded mother of three, is furious that her teenage daughter is being pressured to “enter service” at the temple—a euphemism for servitude cloaked in ritual.</li>
<li>Viewpoint: Shows the economic and bodily exploitation under theocratic control. Religion is used to sanctify labor extraction and keep the poor in place.</li>
<li>Contribution: Iris knows how to actually grow beets and organize labor. She has community ties with other bonded workers and an instinct for logistics.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The Inakos – Refugee Artisans</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Conflict: Originally from a village destroyed in a river shift and denied relocation rights, the Inakos family squats in the outskirts of Citara. Niko Inako forges tools in a hidden kiln and Vela, his partner, is a midwife turned underground teacher.</li>
<li>Viewpoint: Illustrates how climate events exacerbate inequality and how some displaced people become invisible. Also, how tradition limits knowledge-sharing—only sanctioned priests are supposed to teach.</li>
<li>Contribution: Niko and Vela bring technical know-how, a stash of hidden tools, and the moral authority of community caretakers. Vela dreams of a free school where all children learn.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="plot-outline">Plot Outline<a href="#plot-outline" class="material-symbols-outlined anchor" title="Plot Outline">anchor</a></h2>
<h3 id="act-i-quiet-desperation">Act I – Quiet Desperation<a href="#act-i-quiet-desperation" class="material-symbols-outlined anchor" title="Act I – Quiet Desperation">anchor</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A minor flood damages Citara’s southern quarter, causing unrest and resource strain.</li>
<li>Tarin, under surveillance, contacts Iris covertly while working on a flood-mitigation team; he admires her fire.</li>
<li>Iris saves Niko’s child during a crisis and learns of their hidden smithy.</li>
<li>The three families realize they share a vision of a better life, but escaping is dangerous—routes out of the fertile lowlands are watched, and religious exile is forbidden.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="act-ii-the-pact">Act II – The Pact<a href="#act-ii-the-pact" class="material-symbols-outlined anchor" title="Act II – The Pact">anchor</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>After a tragic incident (perhaps Iris’s daughter is publicly shamed or assaulted by temple officials), the families convene in secret.</li>
<li>Tarin shares knowledge of an abandoned terraced slope upstream with old irrigation channels and softer soil—survivable, if hard.</li>
<li>They agree: they will gather trusted allies and flee under the guise of a sanctioned pilgrimage.</li>
<li>Each family risks everything—burning old bridges, stealing or destroying documents, bribing low-ranking guards, and quietly packing tools and seed stock.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="act-iii-the-crossing">Act III – The Crossing<a href="#act-iii-the-crossing" class="material-symbols-outlined anchor" title="Act III – The Crossing">anchor</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The journey upriver is tense. At one point they’re nearly caught by patrols, and must make a dangerous night crossing through the Rhizel’s marsh.</li>
<li>Vela delivers a child mid-journey; the group delays a day, at great risk, to let them recover—cementing their bond and emphasizing their values.</li>
<li>They arrive at a valley ringed by hills and shaded by red-leaved trees: they name it Redvale.</li>
<li>They plant their first beets together, building simple shelters and setting up a shared council.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="coda-first-sprout">Coda – First Sprout<a href="#coda-first-sprout" class="material-symbols-outlined anchor" title="Coda – First Sprout">anchor</a></h3>
<p>The story ends with the first shoots breaking soil, and a quiet vow that no child of Redvale will ever go hungry or be owned.</p>
